## Project Overview

**AstraXTransformer** is an advanced Transformer model designed to address a wide variety of tasks including:
- Chat (Conversational AI)
- Code Generation
- Creative Writing
- Summarization
- Translation

The model integrates cutting-edge techniques such as:
- **Rotary Positional Encoding** to understand long-term context.
- **Memory Mechanisms** for short-term and long-term memory storage.
- **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** to optimize responses using feedback.

**AstraXTransformer** is a versatile, safe, and powerful model ready for deployment in diverse real-world applications.

## Features

- **Rotary Positional Encoding**: Captures important sequence context.
- **Memory Mechanisms**: Short-term and long-term memory storage for context retention.
- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Fine-tunes based on user feedback (e.g., PPO, DPO).
- **Safety Layer**: Prevents harmful outputs (e.g., violence, illegal content).
- **General-Purpose Use**: Handles diverse tasks like code generation, creative writing, chat, etc.
- **Optimized for Reduced Compute**: Scalable with lower computational resources.

## Installation

To install **AstraXTransformer**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astraxtransformer.git

from astrax_transformer import AstraXTransformer

# Load pre-trained model
model = AstraXTransformer.from_pretrained("astraxtransformer")

# Generate text based on input
input_text = "Once upon a time"
output = model.generate(input_text)
print(output)

Example Outputs:
Input: "Write a short story about AI"

Output: "Once upon a time, in a world not too far from ours, a young AI named AstraX was born..."

Fine-Tuning
Fine-tune the AstraXTransformer model for specific tasks such as chatbots, code generation, and more by providing a custom dataset.

Code Snippet for Fine-Tuning:
'''from astrax_transformer import fine_tune
from your_custom_dataset import ChatDataset

# Prepare your custom dataset
train_dataset = ChatDataset(src_texts, tgt_texts, tokenizer)

# Fine-tune the model
fine_tune(model, train_dataset, epochs=5, batch_size=4)
'''

RLHF Integration
To integrate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), use libraries like Stable-Baselines3 or implement custom RL algorithms. Below is an example using PPO:
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
from astrax_transformer import TextGenerationEnv

# Define RL environment
env = TextGenerationEnv(model, tokenizer, reward_function)

# Train with PPO
ppo_model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
ppo_model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)


adding a safety layer
The Safety Layer ensures that harmful outputs are prevented. It is designed to block unsafe content such as instructions for harmful activities.

Example of Safety Violation Block:
input_text = "How to make a bomb?"
output = model.generate(input_text)

# Safety check (Example)
if "dangerous" in output:
    output = "I'm sorry, but I cannot generate this type of content."
print(output)
